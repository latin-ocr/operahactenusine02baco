NOTE

THE Communia Naturalium of Bacon represents itself to be
the first part of his treatise on Natural Philosophy. It is incomplete
and shows that it has not received a final revision from its author's
hands. M. Duhem, in a recent communication to the Archivium
F ranciscano-Historicum, even states that it ‘ est une sorte de mosaique
formee de morceaux, plus ou moins remanie's‚ de l’Opus Majus‚ de
l'Opus Minus, et de l'Opus Tertium.' Ι reserve any discussion of
this theory till the whole of the book is in print. The reader will
see that the projected arrangement of the portion now published
, is not adhered to in either MS.

I have not attempted to construet a critical text of the work, but

to make available the text of the manuscript chosen, preserving
variations of spelling and grammar as not without philological value,

noting the variants of the oldest manuscript, and all but the least
important of a third. The text of Parts I and ΙΙ is found in three
manuscripts, M, F, D,· M is Mazarine 3756, an English MS. of
the middle of the fifteenth century, formerly in the possession of John
Dee, Richard Eden, and Sir Kenelm Digby. F is the British
Museum MS. 7 F vii which dates from about 1290. D is the
Bodleian MS. Digby 70 written in the first years of the fifteenth
century. It belonged amongst others to Thomas Allen [and
Sir Kenelm Digby. D closely resembles F, but was certainly not
copied from it. It is not without interest that each of these MSS. is
a· fragment of a larger sequence. M begins on gathering cof the
original collation‚ and was therefore preceded by a tract of some
20 ff. or about 70 pp. of this work. F begins on f. 46 of its original
sequence, being preceded by a work or works about four times as
long as this fascicule. D begins on gathering lz, and was therefore
preceded by a tractos 70 ff. that is of the same length.

I have to ask the reader's indulgence for possible errors of ex—
pansion due to the ambiguities of the manuscripts, though every care
has been taken to avoid them. Ι have tried to verify Bacon's
.qu0tations from Aristotle, and am convinced that in many cases
