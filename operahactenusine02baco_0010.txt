they were taken from compendia which no longer exist—the form
in which Aristotle's scientific works were probably first introduced—
or from translations as yet undescribed. The variations from known
texts cannot be accounted for by contamination from glosses, &c.‚
having in view the recent introduction of the works. My references
are to the early printed mediaeval translations of Aristotle with the
gloss of Averroes, cited by book and comma. A very convenient
edition for general students is the Venice folio of 1550—2.

It will be unnecessary to recall to students of Bacon that Charles
published considerable extracts from the first two parts of the
Communia Naturalium in his invaluable 'study of 1861. Some
differences will be noticed in the text from his readings. 'They
have been carefully verified, and do not detract from the meritos
his work.

A word should be said of the want of correspondence between
the theoretical (as shown in the chapter headings) and the actual
division of the text. Part Ι, Dist. 3, should have three Chapters, the
text has four. Part II, Dist. 1, should have seven Chapters, it has
four. Dist. 2 should have four (M) or nine (F), M has ten and F four
wrongly numbered 3 Dist. 3 being disregarded in both. Its reinstate-
ment with four chapters, and the fact that two others in Dist. 3 are
not in F, will reduce Dist. 3 to four. Dist. 4 should have six Chapters,
it has three. It is thus evident that the scheme represented by the
rubrics has been but imperfectly carried out. It may be noted that
some of the marginal rubrics of F are in a later hand (c. 1320).

Ι have to express my thanks to Mr. Halliday Sparling‚ Mr. Herbert
of the British Museum, Fr. Michael Bihl, O.F.M.‚ Mr. Ingram
Bywater‚ and to the Clarendon-Press for invaluable assistance in
the preparation of this edition. ‘
